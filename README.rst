jQuery Embedly Scroll Play
==========================
A simple plugin that works with `Embedly <http://embed.ly>`_ and
`Player.js <http://playerjs.io>`_ to autoplay videos when they are scrolled into
frame.


Install
-------
You will need to add the ScrollPlay and Player.js libs your page::

  <script type="text/javascript" src="//cdn.embed.ly/player-0.0.9.min.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="//cdn.embed.ly/jquery.embedly.scrollplay-0.0.1.min.js"></script>


Using ScrollPlay
----------------
Currently this is pretty simple plugin. Here is all of it::

  $('iframe.emebdly-embed').scollplay();

Done. That's it. Good Talk. Glad we did this.
